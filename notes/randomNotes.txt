My local root process group is probably 5cb229a2-015e-1000-af7e-47911f0b10d6

curl notes:
You can get a client-id like this:
curl -i -H "Accept: */*"  -X GET   http://localhost:8080/nifi-api/flow/client-id


Create a template as done in https://community.hortonworks.com/content/kbentry/87160/creating-nifi-template-via-rest-api.html
(but not getting access token and not handling versioning)

Receive from client or assume we know the snippet.parentGroupId and snippet.processGroups.id (which in our snippet-json is not associated with an id field, but is used as a processorGroups key)
Get String result of the following, which becomes the clientId
curl -i -H "Accept: */*"  -X GET   http://localhost:8080/nifi-api/flow/client-id
Do a String replace inside of akka-http-to-nifi/src/main/resources/nifi-templates/emptySnippet.json, where our variables will come from:
    snippet.parentGroupId snippet.processGroups.id  clientId
Send postSnippet(jsonString), which sends that String as Json to /nifi-api/snippets
If that call succeeds, we'll have a JSON return from NIFI. Get snippet.id from that return, call it snippetId
Now make a post:
json:
{
  "name": "My Template",
  "description": "",
  "snippetId": "${snippet.id}"
}
data: nifi-api/process-groups/snippet.parentGroupId/templates


The apparent easy way to create templates and send to NIFI doesn't work
Would like to create template in NIFI gui, and put in some variables so that clients of our service can customize the template they chose
Created a template, saved it, loaded it into our service and converted it to a TemplateDTO
I've been trying to hit the NIFI POST /nifi-api/snippet endpoint, which requires a SnippetEntity.
To create a SnippetEntity you need to supply a SnippetDTO.
But the TemplateDTO owns a FlowSnippetDTO, not a SnippetDTO, and the two don't seem to have much in common.


New idea:
Maybe I need to use this POST if I want to upload or import a template, rather than going by https://community.hortonworks.com/content/kbentry/87160/creating-nifi-template-via-rest-api.html:
/process-groups/{id}/templates/upload /process-groups/{id}/templates/import
---->Overall, maybe I should do stuff in the NIFI GUI and use chrome to see what requests are being made
That GUI should just be using the REST api that I want to use.
