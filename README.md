Work here is based on a [nice Akka HTTP example](https://github.com/theiterators/akka-http-microservice)

Sample run command:

sbt " run sampleInputs/sample1.json"
 
Note: Before running, go to the sample input file you want to use, and change any environment specific settings to something appropriate for your setup.
