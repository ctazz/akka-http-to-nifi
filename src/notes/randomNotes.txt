curl notes:
You can get a client-id like this:
curl -i -H "Accept: */*"  -X GET   http://localhost:8080/nifi-api/flow/client-id


Create a template as done in https://community.hortonworks.com/content/kbentry/87160/creating-nifi-template-via-rest-api.html

Receive from client or assume we know the snippet.parentGroupId and snippet.processGroups.id (which is not associated with an id field, but is used as a processorGroups key)
Get String result of this, which becomes the clientId
curl -i -H "Accept: */*"  -X GET   http://localhost:8080/nifi-api/flow/client-id
Do a String replace inside of akka-http-to-nifi/src/main/resources/nifi-templates/emptySnippet.json, where our variables will come from:
    snippet.parentGroupId snippet.processGroups.id  clientId
Send postSnippet(jsonString), which sends that String as Json to /nifi-api/snippets
If that call succeeds, we'll have a JSON return. Get snippet.id from that return, call it snippetId
Now make a post:
json:
{
  "name": "My Template",
  "description": "",
  "snippetId": "${snippet.id}"
}
data: nifi-api/process-groups/snippet.parentGroupId/templates
